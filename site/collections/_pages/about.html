      <p>Hello there &#128075;, I'm Florante Amonoy, and I'm a software engineer 
        with over ten years of experience developing software, mostly mobile applications. 
        I started my career as a C# developer, building web and mobile applications 
        using ASP.Net and Xamarin Forms for the last eight years.
      </p>

        <p>Switching to Flutter for mobile development</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It was 2020 when I started to explore Flutter as a development tool, as I found it fast,
        responsive, and easy to use, especially when customizing widgets. I have been working 
        for a fintech Australian company as a mobile developer for more than a year now, and 
        I will continue using Flutter as my main tool in the future.
      </p>
